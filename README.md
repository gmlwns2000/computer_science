My Computer Science Class In CAC!!

CAC use Github sorry to looking this project in public I don't have money

- No problem with public; that means other coders can see your work and potentially learn from it or contribute to it.  Public is almost always better than private.
- I'm glad you set up GitHub already.  You need more challenges.  Let's talk in class!
